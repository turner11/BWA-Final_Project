BWA - FInal Project
===

Part of final project in [JCE](http://www.jce.ac.il/).    
The project's focus is on speeding up the Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for pairwise alignment between DNA sequences, and heavily depends on the [BWA project](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).  

The plan is to analyse the code, and implement it using paraleling on grphical cards and cuda.

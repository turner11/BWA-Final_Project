BWA - FInal Project
===

Part of final project in [JCE](http://www.jce.ac.il/).    
The project's focus is on speeding up the Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for pairwise alignment between DNA sequences, and heavily depends on the [BWA project](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).  

The plan is to analyse the code, and implement it using paraleling on grphical cards and cuda.

Project Calendar is available [here](http://projects.jce.ac.il/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?wid=1&title=%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%98&groupanduser=9-26) (Sign in is required).  
List of issues are available [here](https://github.com/turner11/BWA-Final_Project/issues). 

The MAN of the function we will be optimizing is available [here](https://github.com/turner11/BWA-Final_Project/raw/master/Documents/BWA%20aln%20MAN.docx)  
Then MAN of the BWA program is available [here](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#3)
